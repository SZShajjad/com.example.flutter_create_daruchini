* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':flutter_windowmanager'.
> Could not create an instance of type com.android.build.api.variant.impl.LibraryVariantBuilderImpl.
   > Namespace not specified. Specify a namespace in the module's build file: C:\Users\sharm\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\flutter_windowmanager-0.2.0\android\build.gradle. See https://d.android.com/r/tools/upgrade-assistant/set-namespace for information about setting the namespace.
     
     If you've specified the package attribute in the source AndroidManifest.xml, you can use the AGP Upgrade Assistant to migrate to the namespace value in the build file.

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings in the Gradle documentation.
