# 🔬 Scientific Thinking

> Methodology for scientific thought and critical analysis.

## ⚡ Scientific Method (Brief)

Observation → Question → Hypothesis → Testing → Analysis → Conclusion

## 📝 Hypothesis Template

- **Hypothesis**: [Clear, testable statement]
- **Basis**: [Observations/Evidence]
- **Test**: [How it will be verified]
- **Expected Outcome**: [What should happen if true]

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **First Principles**: Deconstruct the problem to its most fundamental truths.
2. **Experiment Design**: Isolate variables to test specific behaviors.
3. **Analysis**: Perform causality analysis and avoid correlation fallacies.

## 🧠 Session Learnings

- **Hypothesis-Driven Debugging**: When a release build fails, formulate a hypothesis (e.g., "The ProGuard rules are missing") and test it specifically rather than blind code changes.
