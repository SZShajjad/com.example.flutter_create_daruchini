# 🤖 Vibe Coder RAG System Manifesto

## 🚀 Purpose

The Antigravity Agentic System is now a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** platform designed specifically for **Non-Technical Vibe Coders**.

## 🧠 How it Works

1. **Context Retrieval**: The agent automatically retrieves relevant "Knowledge Items" (KIs) from `.agent/knowledge/` to inform every decision.
2. **Plain-English Synthesis**: Technical complexity is distilled into job-focused outcomes (e.g., "Making it look premium" vs "Applying corner radius 24px").
3. **Cross-Persona Verification**: The Project Manager ensures that Developer solutions meet the "Vibe" defined by the Designer.

## 📁 Knowledge Base Structure

- `/knowledge/principles/`: Core design & logic philosophies.
- `/knowledge/features/`: Documentation for every feature from a non-technical perspective.
- `/knowledge/troubleshooting/`: Common issues explained in plain English.

## 🛡️ Bulletproof Auth Protocol

- **Persistence**: Automatically handle user sessions.
- **Gracefulness**: Handle every error (Network, Canceled, Weak Pass) with specific friendly guidance.
- **Onboarding flow**: Splash → Login/Signup → (Verification) → Home.

## // RAG-ACTIVE

Every prompt now triggers a look-up into this infrastructure to maintain high-fidelity context.
