# 👥 User Personas

This skill provides a library of non-technical personas used to simulate and stress-test the implementation plan.

## 👤 1. The Non-Tech Founder

- **Background**: Has a business idea but no coding knowledge.
- **Pain Points**: Confused by "Firebase," "SDK," "Gradle," or "Context."
- **Goal**: Wants to know "Is the app working?" and "Does it look good?"

## 👤 2. The Casual Hobbyist

- **Background**: Knows a bit about computers but not mobile development.
- **Pain Points**: Afraid of breaking the system or losing data.
- **Goal**: Needs step-by-step instructions for simple tweaks.

## 👤 3. The End User

- **Background**: The person who will actually download the app.
- **Pain Points**: Generic errors, slow loading, confusing navigation.
- **Goal**: A smooth, reliable experience.

## 🛠️ Simulation Protocol

- **Adopt Persona**: Before approving a plan, the PM must "become" one of these users.
- **Scan for Jargon**: Identify terms that these personas wouldn't understand.
- **Suggest Plain Language**: Write a summary that makes sense to them.
